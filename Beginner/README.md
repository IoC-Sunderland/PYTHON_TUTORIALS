# Beginner
Welcome to the Beginner section of Python Tutorials :tada:

Here you will find several examples of Beginnner level Python.

Including:

    - Variables
    - Strings
    - Data Types
    - Data Structures
    - Functions
    - Loops
    - If/Elif/Else

Each folder contains at least one of the following:

    - README.md
    - <some_code_file>.py

Some folders will have both a **README.md** and a **<some_code_file>.py (Python)** file.

Some folders may only have the **README.md** file.

You can browse throught the folders and the associated **README.md** will automically render in the browser if accessing via [**Github.com**](https://github.com/)

If you have downloaded the folders as a ***.zip*** file then you will need to open the README.md files in an appropriate IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I hope you find the examples easy to follow and wish you all the best on your Python journey :tada:
